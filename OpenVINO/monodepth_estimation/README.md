# Monodepth Estimation with OpenVINO

This project implements a **monodepth estimation** pipeline using OpenVINO for inference on a CPU. The application captures live video from the camera, processes each frame to estimate depth, and generates a heatmap representing the distances between objects and the camera.

## How It Works

This program performs real-time depth estimation and visualization by:

- **Estimating Depth**: Using a pretrained MiDaS model, the application calculates the depth of objects in the cameraâ€™s field of view.
- **Creating a Heatmap**: The depth information is transformed into a color-coded heatmap, making it easy to visually interpret the relative distances of objects.
- **Optimizing Inference on CPU**: By leveraging OpenVINO, the application runs efficiently on a CPU, making it suitable for use in embedded systems and environments with limited resources.
